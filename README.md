***R studio App we built during Carolina Data Challenge to visualize the dynamic crime rate changes at each precinct of New York City.***

Users can specify which month and hour of interests and conduct exploratory data analysis or animate the dynamic hourly changes.

We hope by building this app, we can alert people walking on the ground if there is any potential danger.
